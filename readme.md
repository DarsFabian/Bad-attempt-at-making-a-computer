# This is (probably) a bad attempt at making an emulator mimicking the functionning of a computer

## I will not use any standard library and what not because duck it.

### No but for real the end goal is to make an OS, just for fun, so I have to start somewhere right?

#### Guess it would be fun to make my own assembly language for this computer... probably.

## Roadmap (lets get started!)

- Emulating a CPU

- Emulating the RAM

- Interrupts!

- Assembly!!

- Not regretting this project.
